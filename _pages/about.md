About me

I'm a first-year graduate student from [MSCS program](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/), [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), advised by [Prof.Bo Zhu](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~bozhu/). My research interests lie in computer graphics, computational physics, and artificial intelligence. I received my B.E. from Nankai University, where I was advised by [Prof. Bo Ren](https://ren-bo.net/).
